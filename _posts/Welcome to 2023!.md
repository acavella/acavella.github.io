Welcome to 2023! I find myself looking back at 2022 and wondering where the time went. If you look back at the history of posts on this site, it also reflects a simlar feeling.  A couple posts around the start of the year and then nothing until now. 

As with every attempt at posting, I have good intentions to post regularly. So what's different this time? Probably not much, but my strategy is to avoid the pressure of long form posting.  I am going to post notes or other bits and not necessarly feel pressured to post long form developed articles.

So with that said, I say welcome to 2023. I can only hope that it is a big year and welcome you along for the ride!
