Following up on last year's post, we'll take a look at how my desktop has evolved on my laptop.  We've moved from Fedora 35 to 37; again I like things stable so you won't find my systems running bleeding edge. I've also left behind Plasma and moved over to the Budgie desktop. Budgie is such a simple and clean desktop experience, it matches me perfectly. 

We are on the verge of a new version of Fedora with a official Budgie Desktop spin. I can't wait to see where we are next year around this time!
