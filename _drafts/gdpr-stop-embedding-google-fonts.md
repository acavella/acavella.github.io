In a recent ruling from a German Court in Munich, a website owner was ordered to pay &#128;100 fine for the use of embedded fonts. The court ruled that the use of Google's embedded font service was in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The court ruled that the plaintiff's IP address was transferred without consent via the Google Fonts library. The ruling read as follows:
<blockquote>
  <p>Dynamic IP addresses represent personal data for the operator of a website because, in the abstract, he has the legal means that could reasonably be used to, with the help of third parties, namely the competent authority and the Internet access provider, identify the person concerned based on the stored IP â€“ to have addresses determined</p>
</blockquote>
## What is Google Font Library
The Google Font Library is a collection of online fonts that can be used when publishing a website. Since the font library is hosted online, this allows a website to use fonts from the online library and ensure they are presented to the visitor properly, even if the visitor doesn't have the particular font on their local computer. The font is retrieved from the online library and the website is viewed by the visitor just as it was intended when designed. This can be extra important to a major company or entity who may have a brand image to present and wants to ensure it represented in a consistant way for all visitors.
