title: Automating WD MyCloud Backups to Backblaze

Recently I decided I needed to take a more serious approach to data storage and ultimately data backup. In the past I've been, what can I say, careless with my data. Bulk storage has been completed on various USB hard drives and critical files have been backed up directly to the cloud (Google, OneDrive). I will say, this strategy has served me well enough for years, however, in the event of a major situation where I needed to recover everything, I can't imagine it would be an easy task. 

## The NAS
When looking at different NAS solutions, I decided to stay in the sub $500 range.  All of these options are ARM based NAS with between 2 and 4 drives.  The biggest difference between them is the web-gui which and what prebuilt apps come with the NAS.  If you look at the higherend options, you'll see apps for using your NAS as a Plex server or Docker host.  None of these features were important to me, essentially I found myself looking for a NAS that supported 1Gbps networking, with as few additional options as possible.  The fewer additional features, the cheaper the bare enclosure cost, leaving more money for the important piece; large, reliable hard disks.

I ultimately settled on the Western Digital (WD) MyCloud EX2 Ultra.  This ARM based NAS can support two (2) 3.5" hard drives in RAID-1. For them I chose two (2) 12 terrabyte WD Red NAS Pro hard drives. As with most people (I assume) the biggest item I backup is my photo collections. I am not a Youtube content creator, I don't have 100s of terrabytes worth of videos, etc..
