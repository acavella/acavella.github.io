### Who am I?

<p style="medium">Hey, my name is Tony Cavella and this is my personal blog. It serves no particular niche, but gives me a place to express myself and write about various topics. I cannot guarentee any regular schedule of updates, but will try to post semi-regularly.</p>

<p>My day job keeps me busy primarily as a Linux System Engineer where I support multiple projects in the mobility sector.</p>
